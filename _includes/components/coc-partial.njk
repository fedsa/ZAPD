      </article>
      <article class="right-copy">
        <p>ZAProductDesign, and it's admins, acknowledge that finding skilled people in South Africa is a serious problem that needs serious attention. However, the ZAProductDesign slack channel is first and foremost a safe space for people to talk, share and collaborate. Therefore, the following specific conditions regarding recruitment, and recruitment opportunities, apply:</p>
        <ul data-rte-list="default">
          <li>Unsolicited professional recruiting is not allowed on ZAProductDesign under any circumstances.</li>
          <li>Users (including admins) may not under any circumstances share personal details of ZADesign members with recruiters without that user's explicit consent.</li>
          <li>Advertising an opportunity in brief within the #jobpostings channel is acceptable. Further discussions must happen via direct messages.</li>
          <li>Opportunities must not, under any circumstances, use referral programme links where the poster of the message could benefit, e.g. via earning a commission.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We value being able to attract talent to our teams, and a brief message should allow it. </p>

      <h2>Unsolicited private messages (DMs)</h2>
      <p>
        While the community aims to be a place for members of the community to meet and connect, it's also important to respect each other's privacy. If you feel as though a service you provide or business you run may be of use to another member, please respect their privacy and first ask publicly if you may contact them about such discussions before sending unsolicited messages.

      <article class="left-copy p-r-32">     
        <p>If you are being harassed by a member of ZAProductDesign, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns there are a few methods for reporting. Administrators will respond as soon as they are able. If the person who is harassing you is on the admin team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. Listed from most public to most anonymous:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Post a message in the #code-of-conduct channel</li>
          <li>DM an administrator</li>

        <p>In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.</p>
        <p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of ZAProductDesign members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent. </p>

      <h2>Acceptable Content</h2>
      <p>The ZAProductDesign community is a collection of design professionals, as such it is expected that the content made available by members of the community should at all times adhere to the acceptable content policy. This policy is intended to protect the community's image, as well as the image of its members, through restrictions on certain classes of content which may be deemed to be unsuitable in a work or family context.</p>
      <p>Links to content are deemed as acceptable as the content within.</p>
      <p>Classes of content which we deem to be unsuitable include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pornographic or sexually suggestive material, either in graphic or text form</li>
        <li>Depictions of physical or emotional abuse, either in graphic or text form</li>
        <li>Persecution of any individual as a result of their race, gender, religion or other physical traits</li>
        <li>Material intended to, without basis, harm the reputation of any individual whether a member or not</li>
        <li>Unsolicited advertising with the exception of job offers in the #jobpostings channel</li>
        <li>Links, or links to pages, for the purpose of monetisation of user views and which provide no value to the ZAProductDesign community</li>
        <li>Content infringing on copyright laws</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As a quick self-check, ask yourself whether you would like someone's child to see the content you are posting. If the answer is "no", then there's a good chance you shouldn't be posting it on the ZAProductDesign community.</p>
